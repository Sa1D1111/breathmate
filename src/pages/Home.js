         <h3>1. Box Breathing</h3>
         <img src={require('../images/4-7-8.jpg')} alt="Breathwork" className="hero-image" />

         <p>Box breathing, also known as square breathing or 4-4-4-4 breathing, helps to focus on taking slow, deep breaths. It’s used by a wide variety of professionals and athletes for stress reduction and improved performance. Here’s how to do it:</p>
         <ol>
           <li>Sit up straight and exhale slowly out your mouth.</li>
           <li>Breathe in through your nose for a count of 4.</li>
           <li>Hold your breath for another count of 4.</li>
           <li>Breathe out through your mouth for a count of 4.</li>
           <li>Hold your breath for a count of 4 and repeat.</li>
         </ol>
         </section>

         
 
<section className="science-section">
  <h3>The Science</h3>
  <p>Box breathing was developed by Mark Divine, a former Navy SEAL commander, who has been using the technique since 1987. It’s regularly used by people in high-stress environments due to its ability to turn off a person’s fight-or-flight mode. Using this exercise is seen as a great method of relaxation, since it distracts your mind from the stresses around you as you focus specifically on your breathwork. Popular meditation app Headspace lists it as one of several techniques that have been proven to help reduce stress.</p>


  <h3>Benefits</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Allows you to feel calm and regulate your autonomic nervous system.</li>
    <li>Can help to regulate body temperature.</li>
    <li>Can help lower blood pressure.</li>
    <li>Reduces stress and improves mood, assisting with anxiety, panic disorder, PTSD, and depression.</li>
    <li>Can help treat insomnia when practiced before bed.</li>
    <li>Can help with pain management.</li>
  </ul>
</section>


<section className="Diaphramic-section">

         <h3>2. Diaphragmatic Breathing</h3>
         <p>Diaphragmatic breathing, also known as belly breathing or abdominal breathing, is breathwork that utilizes the stomach, abdomen, and diaphragm. It works by using your muscles to force your diaphragm to move as you breathe, allowing your lungs to fill with more air. Here’s how to do it:</p>
         <ol>
           <li>Sit in a comfortable position or lie down on a flat surface. You can sit on a pillow or place them under your head and knees to keep you comfortable.</li>
           <li>Relax your shoulders.</li>
           <li>Place one hand on your upper chest.</li>
           <li>Place the other hand on your stomach between the rib cage and diaphragm.</li>
           <li>Slowly breathe in through your nose. Focus on drawing the air down towards your stomach as you push it against your hand. Try to keep your chest still.</li>
           <li>Tighten your abdominal muscles and let your stomach fall while pressing downward as you breathe out through your lips. Continue to try to keep your chest still.</li>
           <li>Continue to inhale and exhale as desired.</li>
         </ol>
         <p>This technique helps improve lung capacity and promote relaxation.</p>

<section className="Purse-Lip-section">

         <h3>3. Pursed Lip Breathing</h3>
         <p>Pursed lip breathing involves slowly breathing in and out through pursed lips. This is a technique used to give you more control over your breath and ultimately make your breaths more impactful. Here’s how to do it:</p>
         <ol>
           <li>Sit up straight or lie down with your shoulders relaxed.        </li>
           <li>Breathe in through your nose for a count of 2. Try to feel the air moving into your abdomen, not just your lungs.           </li>
           <li>Purse your lips and breathe out slowly for a count of 4. For this step, you should always breathe out for twice the length that you breathed in.           </li>
           <li>Repeat as desired.</li>
    
         </ol>
         <p>This technique helps improve lung capacity and promote relaxation.</p>
       </section>
 
       <section className="science-section">
       <h3>The Science</h3>
<p>Pursed lip breathing has shown to strengthen your lungs with regular practice. This technique focuses on slowing your breaths and emptying stale air from your lungs, which is beneficial for those struggling with chronic lung disease and other conditions. A 2018 study exploring the effects of pursed lip breathing showed improvements among patients with COPD. It’s also an effective aid when accomplishing difficult physical tasks, such as climbing the stairs. It should be noted that this technique works best when you’re already relaxed.</p>

  <h3>Benefits</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Relieves shortness of breath.    </li>
    <li>Reduces the work required to breathe.    </li>
    <li>Removes carbon dioxide trapped in your lungs and brings in more fresh air.    </li>
    <li>Assists with conditions that make it difficult to breathe, including asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, and COPD.    </li>
    
  </ul>

<section className="478-section">

         <h3>4. 4-7-8 Breathing</h3>
         <p>4-7-8 breathing is a technique based on pranayama breathwork (we’ll discuss this more in the next section). It allows users to gain control of their breath and can even work as a sleep aid. Here’s how to do it:</p>
         <ol>
           <li>As you part your lips, breathe out through your mouth while making a whooshing sound.</li>
           <li>Close your mouth and inhale through your nose to the count of 4.</li>
           <li>Hold your breath for a count of 7.</li>
           <li>Make another whooshing sound as you breathe out your mouth for a count of 8.</li>
           <li>Repeat these steps as much as desired.    </li>
         </ol>
       </section>
 
       <section className="science-section">
       <h3>The Science</h3>
<p>The 4-7-8 breathing technique is another technique that promotes relaxation. As a result, it has been successful in regulating the fight-or-flight response and helping to combat stress and anxiety. By forcing you to focus on your breaths rather than your worries, it helps you achieve a state of calm and more easily fall asleep. An article from The Sustainable Training Method even claims it can also help soothe your heart rate.</p>

  <h3>Benefits</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Helps control mood and improves stress and anxiety levels. </li>
    <li>Assists in falling asleep and decreases fatigue. </li>
    <li>Reduces cravings.</li>
    <li>Reduces asthma symptoms.</li>
    <li>Reduces hypertension.</li>
    <li>Improves migraine symptoms.</li>
  </ul>

<section className="Alternate-section">

         <h3>5. Alternate nostril Breathing</h3>
         <p>lternate nostril breathing is an exercise that allows you to practice breath control. It is often done during yoga or meditation, and it can also be practiced as part of pranayama breathwork. Here’s how to do it:</p>
         <ol>
           <li>Sit down with your legs crossed.           </li>
           <li>Place your left hand on your left knee and lift your right hand up to your nose. </li>
           <li>Breathe out, then close your right nostril with your right thumb.           </li>
           <li>Breathe in through your left nostril, then use your fingers to close it.      </li>
           <li>Release your thumb from your right nostril and breathe out through this side.</li>
           <li>Breathe in through your right nostril, then close it again with your thumb.</li>
           <li>Release your fingers from your left nostril and breathe out through this side. You’ve now completed a full cycle.</li>
           <li>Repeat as much as desired, being sure to end on a completed cycle.           </li>

         </ol>
       </section>
 
       <section className="science-section">
       <h3>The Science</h3>
<p>Alternate nostril breathing works under the knowledge that the left nostril increases activity in the right side of your brain, while breathing through the right nostril increases activity in the left. While the right side of our brains is responsible for emotions and creativity, the left side is responsible for logic and language. By breathing through both sides equally, you help to stimulate both parts of your brain. A study by the International Journal of Yoga found that alternate nostril breathing is effective in lowering stress levels.</p>

  <h3>Benefits</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Allows you to feel calm and regulate your autonomic nervous system.</li>
    <li>Reduces stress and anxiety.</li>
    <li>Improves cardiovascular health, including heart rate.</li>
    <li>Improves lung function and respiratory endurance.</li>
    <li>Enhances overall physical and mental health.    </li>
  </ul>
</section>




<section className="Breath-Focus-section">

         <h3>6. Breath Focus Breathing</h3>
<p>Breath focus, also known as mindful breathing, is a technique that has practitioners focus on imagery, words, or phrases. These images or words will often be ones that contribute to feelings of happiness, relaxation, or neutrality. Here’s how to do it:</p>
         <ol>
          <li>Sit or lie down in a comfortable position.</li>
      <li>Switch between normal breathing and deep breathing a few times, paying attention to how they differ from each other and how your abdomen moves.</li>
      <li>Switch between normal breathing and deep breathing a few times, paying attention to how they differ from each other and how your abdomen moves.</li>
      <li>Take a few shallow breaths, noticing how they differ from your deep breaths.
      </li>
      <li>Continue to deep breathe for a few more minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Place a hand below your belly button as you relax your stomach. Pay attention to how it rises and falls as you continue to breathe.
      </li>
      <li>Every time you breathe out, let out a loud sigh.
      </li>
      <li>As you continue to breathe deeply, begin to focus on a relaxing image, word, or phrase of your choice.
      </li>
      <li>Imagine the air you breathe in is a wave bringing peace and calm into your body. You can mentally say “inhaling peace and calm” as you do this.
      </li>
      <li>As you breathe out, picture any negativity you’re feeling being washed away. You can mentally say “exhaling tension and anxiety” as you do this.
      </li>
      <li>You have now completed a breath focus session.
      </li>


      </ol>
       </section>
 
       <section className="science-section">
       <h3>The Science</h3>
<p>The breath focus technique is common to yoga, meditation, and various therapies for its ability to help with stress reduction. It’s believed that focusing on our breath can lead to positive physical and mental changes. A study by the Journal of Neurophysiology recently showed that the regions of our brain linked to emotions, attention, and body awareness actually light up when we engage in focused breathing. Additional studies showed that it can be used for stress reduction based on the areas of the brain that lit up during rapid breathing and focused breathing.</p>

  <h3>Benefits</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Reduces stress and anxiety.</li>
    <li>Increases alertness and improves concentration.</li>
    <li>Boosts your immune system.</li>
    <li>Increases vitality.</li>
  </ul>

<section className="Equal-section">

         <h3>7. Equal Breathing</h3>
         <p>Equal breathing, also known as circular breathing or sama vritti, is an exercise that focuses on making your inhales and exhales the same length. This is done to make your breaths smooth and steady and to help you achieve a sense of balance and equanimity. Here’s how to do it:</p>
         <ol>
           <li>Sit in a comfortable position or lie down on a flat surface. You can sit on a pillow or place them under your head and knees to keep you comfortable.</li>
           <li>Relax your shoulders.</li>
           <li>Breathe in and out through your nose. </li>
           <li>Count your inhales and exhales to make sure that they are the same length. If this is uneasy, select a word or phrase to mentally say with every inhale and exhale.</li>
           <li>You can also take a short pause between each inhale and exhale if this is helpful.</li>
           <li>Continue to inhale and exhale as desired.</li>
         </ol>
       </section>
 
       <section className="science-section">
       <h3>The Science</h3>

<p>Equal breathing engages your parasympathetic nervous system, which helps you to achieve relaxation. It works well for those looking to ease their stress and anxiety quickly, which was documented in a 2017 study. It’s also recommended as an exercise prior to going to bed since it works similarly to counting sheep. This is because it helps you to focus on measuring your breaths instead of any of the racing thoughts in your head.</p>

  <h3>Benefits</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Calms your nerves.    </li>
    <li>Improves your focus and concentration.</li>
    <li>Helps to quiet the mind.</li>
    <li>Allows you to access your full breathing capacity.</li>
  </ul>
</section>



<section className="Resonant-section">

         <h3>8. Resonant Breathing</h3>
         <p>Resonant breathing, also known as coherent breathing, is when one breathes at a rate of 5 breaths per minute. This is one of the simplest exercises that can be done anywhere at any time. Here’s how to do it:</p>
         <ol>
           <li>Get into a comfortable position of your choice.</li>
           <li>Breathe in for a count of 5. </li>
           <li>Breathe out for a count of 5.</li>
           <li>Continue these steps as desired.</li>
    
         </ol>
         <p>This technique helps improve lung capacity and promote relaxation.</p>
       </section>
 
       <section className="science-section">
       <h3>The Science</h3>

<p>A 2017 study determined that resonant breathing improves heart rate and mood. Since resonant breathing is designed to help you breathe at 5 breaths per minute, this allows you to maximize your heart rate variability (HRV). Since your heart rate is linked to your nervous system, you can easily improve your HRV with breathwork and also calm your nerves. This helps relieve stress and, when combined with Iyengar yoga, can help reduce symptoms of depression.</p>

  <h3>Benefits</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Can help treat insomnia.</li>
    <li>Reduces stress and anxiety and can relieve depression symptoms.    </li>
    <li>Can help lower blood pressure.</li>
    <li>Reduces stress and improves mood, assisting with anxiety, panic disorder, PTSD, and depression.</li>
    <li>Relieves symptoms related to asthma, COPD, fibromyalgia, and IBS.    </li>
    <li>Can help with pain management.</li>
  </ul>
